# Mapping-Political-Communities-into-R^n
## Goals 
1. Summarize current approaches about cluster/latent-memberships analysis of political network with potential shortages of them. 
2. Introduce the graph embedding that complements the 1's shortages.

## General Trends in PolSci over Network analysis
- partitioning of political network into similarly behaving communities is their big interest.

## Literatures
### Mapping Political Communities: A Statistical Analysis of Lobbying Networks in Legislative Politics
paper http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/network.pdf
appendix http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/appendix_network.pdf

#### Goal
- Inferring political actorsâ€™ latent memberships
- Especially focusing on weighted edge relation between interest group (e.g. corporation) and legislators
#### Starting notion
- Previous empirical studies of interest group politics have been limited by the difficulty of observing the ties between interest groups and politicians directly

#### Methodology
  
#### Pros and Cons
- Confined to Bipartite Graph. Easy to interpret and model the already-bipartitely set intuition. Not extensible to another graphical relationship. Relationship usually much more complex however, priorly confine those relationship into bipartite.
